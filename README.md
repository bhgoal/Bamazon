# Bamazon

## About
Bamazon is a Node command line application that allows users to simulate operating and shopping on an Amazon-like web store that stores data in MySQL databases.

## Usage:
*bamazonCustomer.js* allows a user to act as a customer, shopping for items and purchasing them.
*bamazonManager.js* allows a user to perform Manager tasks such as checking and updating inventory levels or adding new products.

## Notes:
*bamazonSupervisor* is in development and will allow users to view sales figures for each department and calculate their profits.
